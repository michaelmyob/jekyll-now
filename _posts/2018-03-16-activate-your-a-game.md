## Learning Lab: "Activate Your A-Game"

Background:
- This workshop was conducted by Dr Cory Middleton on 13 March 2018.
- It was a 2 hour workshop where I learned about recognising and understanding our mindset as human beings, and how to get the most of out of ourselves. The mindset we take towards what we do every day is a choice - be aware of it. Control it.
- The facilitator was from a sports psychology background, having previously worked with top athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport.

Workshop Notes:
- __Activity: "Draw a portrait of your partner"__
  - In this activity we had two minutes to draw a portrait of our nearest seated neighbour.
  - The outcome of this activity was to demonstrate to us that people often go into a task with preconceived ideas of their abilities. Some people, like myself, were apologising to their partner before we'd even finished. It showed that we went into the task without thinking it was going to be good, right from the beginning.
  - Am I bought in? How serious am I going to take this?
  - `Key Takeaway:` Preconceived notions of what I'm capable of are a choice that I subconsciously make. It's easy to go into starting a task without truly believing you can make a solid attempt to do it really well to the best of your ability.

- __Conceptual Note: The process, NOT the setting of goals...__
  - The facilitator mentioned that a typical business approach is 'strategy in' -> 'results out'. Quarter-by-quarter style of thinking.
  - In reality, 'stuff' gets in the way every day.
  - We brainstormed together in small groups about what might get in the way of achieving goals. Some of these included:
    - Setting unclear goals
    - Doubting ourselves
    - Setting goals too ambitious, perhaps out of our control
    - Having too many goals, putting too much self-pressure on
    - Higher priority tasks coming up day-to-day __This was the important one__
  - Setting SMART goals is important, but really it's more about the _process_ of achieving those goals that's the hard part - and generally navigating your life around things that get in the way of achieving them.

- __Activity: "A variety of handshakes"__
  - In this activity we had to shake the hands of other people in the room, pretending various scenarios existed. For example, the first handshake was with someone when you know someone else in the room is important, the next was that you think the person is suspicious, next, that they're very important, and finally, that they're a long, lost friend.
  - `Key Takeaway:` We make a subconscious choice about how our body behaves based on what we are thinking. The body will follow what the mind decides.

- __Conceptual Note: A-Game vs F-Game - Two opposite ends of the spectrum__
  - The facilitator started by talking about what it's like to be in your "F-Game".
  - __F-Game__ notions:
    - Feeling stressed
    - Feeling defensive
    - Everything is overwhelming
    - Feeling frustrated
  - __P.L.O.M.__ "Poor Little Old Me" is the common expression used to indicate someone on their F-Game. Everything is someone else's fault, the world is against them. They gossip. They complain.
  - PLOM's are infectious. They bring others down with them. _"Misery loves company"_.
  - If you get feedback from your mentors/managers in this state, you become standoffish in this state, because you're obsessed with the problem.
  - __A-Game__ notions:
    - Feeling happy
    - Feeling confident
    - Feeling relaxed
    - You have drive, you're awake and ready to go
    - You don't see failures as errors - you see them as learning opportunities.
  - `Key Takeaway:` Notice how many people make a conscious decision to be stuck in the "PLOM"/F-Game state. It's their choice to be there. Why? Because people who are in their A-Game are feeling the same frustrations too, but they don't let it get to them and allow others to bring them down. They brush little annoyances away, they focus on the goal, the outcome, the result. They find a way.

- __Conceptual Note: The psychology of this behaviour...__
  - Understanding attitude = control
  - A 'sense of approval' is a common way of driving you from A -> F. That is, from anyone - a manager, a mentor). Not noticing progress and getting criticism back only is something that can drive you down, if you're in that F-Game mindset.
  - Things like: results, being valued, sense of belonging, respect, talent (recognition) are all things that can drive you between A -> F and F -> A.
  - Note: these are all 'feel' type things. They are on the exterior, outside. It's reactive.
  - The psychologists call this an __outside-in__ way of thinking. You react to the outside world and it drives you. Toughness and resilience is not coming from this.
  - Compare this to people on their A-Game that think more __inside-out__. They control what they can.
  - `Key Takeaway:` If you want motivation and confidence, it comes from within.

- __STRATEGIES__
- __STRATEGY 1: Sheer will is not enough... Focus on mastery__
  - Mastering the discipline in a repetitive manner will shape your behaviour
  - Physical analogy - the facilitator asked a volunteer to push their up towards the force of him pushing down on it with his fingers, and the volunteer came down within a few seconds. The facilitator then asked the volunteer to focus on a part of the wall and imagine their arm was connected via a strong impenetrable cable. The volunteer then appeared to be much stronger when the facilitator was pushing down.
  - If you focus on the method, you get more out of yourself.
  - Think about the 'race plan' - a very sporting term, but it's applicable to our workplace.
  - Analogy to the 'pressure cooker' situation. No need to be a perfectionist. Getting good at mastering something takes time, and we can be quick to judge whether we did something 'good' or 'bad'.
  - `Key Takeaway:` Mastery takes time, energy and commitment. Don't be quick to claim that you screwed something up - focus on it being a learning experience in getting better. World class athletes train daily to master their own crafts.

- __STRATEGY 2: Anticipate obstacles... And choose your response__
  - The facilitator used an analogy with a balloon blowing up and getting to the point of deflating quickly and running out of energy.
  - A day of all good things in a row and one little thing that deflates you can really bring you down.
  - What are those 'little pricks'? Little things that annoy you.
  - A-Game thinking: _"Don't cry over spilled milk"_.
  - Extraordinary things are created twice: mentally, and then physically. Analogy: architect building a house. Little prick moments when in PLOM behaviour can mean you are limited by these obstacles.
  - `Key Takeaway:` Frustrations are often only temporary, move on. Awareness is the key - use the provided A-Game Wristband for a week. Change wrists when you feel a PLOM moment has entered your mind. Be aware of it, and move on.

- __STRATEGY 3: Progress over perfection__
  - Perfectionists often fall into a thinking trap. We're about learning, perfection isn't critical.
  - We can be quick to judge our failures. Compounding these can get you down to F-Game behaviour.
  - Use a _1. Learn -> 2. Change -> 3. Celebrate_ style mind-map to judge yourself in a different way. Focus on learnings.
  - Do this for 1 month daily in a diary until you become familiar with this style of thinking.
