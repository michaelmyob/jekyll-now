### Full information: Accounting Workshop Prototype

__The Observation: Domain Knowledge__

As you may be aware, I come from an accounting background; I’m a CA and I made a career change to become a developer. I’ve noticed there is a big shortage of domain knowledge in EX. After attending the _MYOB Bookkeeping 101 Learning Lab_ alongside other developers/designers I can see there a big problem - this is a complex domain and it’s too much information to absorb in one day. Also, most people don’t revisit the material from that workshop.  

__The Goal__

Ultimately, my goal is to bring our domain knowledge to a higher level in EX. I think technical people do their best work and are more engaged and motivated by their work if they understand the domain they're working in really well. My ideal world is to work alongside developers, designers, BA's, QA's, DL's, DM's, and the like, all of whom know and understand our domain.

__My Experience__

After running a couple of short ‘Accounting Fundamentals’ talks for newly hired proteges and receiving some really good feedback, I’ve been thinking about prototyping an accounting workshop series for people from non-accounting backgrounds. I have a lot of study materials that I’ve acquired over many years and I genuinely love teaching people. I also used to be a tutor at Adelaide Uni and facilitated ~200 seminars in total.  

__The Proposal Details__

I’d like to propose a concept to you: A weekly seminar-style accounting and bookkeeping series.  

- Focus on practical activities set up for you to practise in class **and** in your own time and then we run through them in the following week. I believe it’s important to mull over some concepts and actually do problems on your own (or in groups).
- Focus on whiteboard and on-paper activities; no death by PowerPoint.
- Runs for ~6 weeks with a defined curriculum.
- Facilitated in time slots that avoid conflict with your regular crew commitments (and my crew commitments).
- Potential for beginner / advanced courses later down the track. In the distant future, perhaps we could even have other facilitators do this weekly.

__The Call To Action__

I’d like to gather your interest in something like this and set up an initial trial group as I put the content together and gather regular feedback. Would anyone be keen to put themselves forward for a commitment like this?  

I’m a morning person. I’m thinking between **8am and 9.30am once per week on a Tuesday or Thursday**, likely starting **end of August or early September**. I know this won't work for everyone. In a future revision I'm happy to run this in a later time slot.

I will take the first 10 people that write that they’re interested in the thread (not reactions). Hence, please reply on the Slack message as a thread if interested.
